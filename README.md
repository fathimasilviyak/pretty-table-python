# pretty-table-python

PrettyTable lets you print tables in an attractive ASCII form.
First we have to intall the prettytable package into our code(files->settings->Project: project_name->project interpreter->add package->select and install package).
Then import the PrettyTable class from that package.
Then create an object for the PrettyTable class. eg: table = PrettyTable().
Then we can access the attributes and methods assosciated with the created object of the PrettyTable class.
We can inser the data as column by column or row by row.
We can change different alignment of the table by assigning different values to the attributes of the PrettyTable class.
